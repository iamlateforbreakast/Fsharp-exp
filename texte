Scope
=====
This document reviews 2 different Data Handling architectures and attempts to estimate the development cost of a lunar rover system from a systeme software perspective as a parametric coefficient applied to the SFR original software development cost (150000h). An attempt at parametric FA cost is also provided.

TODO: Provide RFM architecture description.

Architectural Consideration
===â‰ =======================
When considering a system software, the following component are identified:
o GNC
o Data handling
o FDIR & Operations
o Infrastructure

In order to provide a unified synthetic view across all components, coefficients are allocated to each component.
o GNC (25%)
o Data Handling (25%)
o FDIR & Operations (25%)
o Infrastructure (25%)

Architecture A
==============
o GNC Architecture
o Data Handling Architecture
o FDIR Architecture
Architecture A requires the acquisition of an external supervisor license.

Architecture B
==============
o GNC Architecture
Currently, the GNC uses 2 closed loops. One closed loop is between path control and locomotion management to assess the effects of wheel actuation. The other closed loop is between the path control and the visual odometry. In the architecture, the locomotion is controlled by the platform computer and the visual odometry by the DPU. [Fig]

o Software Architecture

o Data Architecture
The mechanisms to exchange data between the platform OBC and DPU needs to be established. For example,

o FDIR Architecture
A strong characteristic of this architecture, it the extreme simplification of the failure management at DPU level. A failure a GNC sensor would invalidate the whole chain. The DPU would mark the chain as failed. The platform OBC would then need to switch to the redundant sensor chain.

Conclusion
=========
Both architecture A and B, if selected require up front effort to confirm their cost impact. Architecture A requires preliminary assessment understand the impact of separating the execution of the GNC algorithms as well as structural impact on data management.
Architecture B requires preliminary assessment to understand the feasibility to isolate the GNC execution.

TODO: Propose RND plan.
